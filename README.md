Core styles for starting a Capital Framework project.
It includes Less variables, Less mixin utilities and class utilities,
standard base styling, and typography styles including heading hierarchy, links,
and some handy webfont mixins.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/).

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to
Capital Framework, we encourage you to [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/).
